# MakeIt-App
This was a project I built for the App Development class I took in high school. Building this project I taught msyelf swift programming, Firebase backend, webscraping with Octoparse, and SQL database management. 

Problem Statement: How can I design an app that makes STEM education more fun and accessible?

Challenges in pursuing STEM:
Time and curriculum constraints for teachers
High cost/resource barrier for independent projects

Solution: Make It! Is an app that allows users to input materials and tools they already have and suggests projects to build based on those materials. The emphasis on using materials users already have lowers the cost entry barrier to pursue a project. Rather than having to spend time researching and sourcing materials for a project, the app recommends something users can get started on right away! Features include project search, smart materials suggestions, and learning resources.


Itâ€™s like a recipe app where you enter what ingredients you have in your pantry and it outputs recipe ideas, but instead it outputs project ideas based on user materials.
